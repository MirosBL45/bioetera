Hello :)

This is a Next.JS app for Bioetera company.

It's just the beginning, we're starting work. I hope that it will be done as soon as possible, but certainly in the best possible way so that the people from the company Bioetera will be very satisfied.

For database, I used hygraph.com.

App will be in 2 languages, Serbian and English. Localization is used in hygraph for the text from back, and for the static text, localization is on the front of app.

Style is going to be done with modules-css.

After clone:
1) npm install
2) npm run dev

Any advice is wellcome :)
